Hi Everyone, I hope all is well.

Many of you will have seen Terry's email a couple of weeks ago - I would be keen to start working on the R introduction document, building on Nigel De Silva's document.

Nigel's document already contains an excellent guide to getting started and some examples of Generalised Linear Models and Linear Regression.

I would like to extend this to include more examples including the topics below:
1.  Machine Learning
2.  Simulation and bootstrapping
3.  Smoothing
4.  More regression/glm examples and tests

A couple of other ideas to get started (especially if like me you are not an R expert yet!):
1.  Rumour has it that the institute will potentially be including R as part of the exams. Does anyone have any advice as to who we could contact to see whether material is being produced to help students?
2.  In relation to 1, could we replicate some past exam questions in R, for example regression questions from CT3? Or Monte Carlo simulation?

Please comment below with your ideas if you are interested in getting involved in this document. This should support Matt's output from research articles in R as well.

Kind regards,
Sophie
